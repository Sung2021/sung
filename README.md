# About_Me
This is a repository to introduce myself as a bioinformatician

## Introduction 
Skilled and experienced senior bioinformatics scientist with diverse research history. Expertise in analysis of integration of mult-iomic data including scRNA-seq, TCR-seq, ATAC-seq, Cut&Run, and bulk RNA-seq. Excellent working knowledge in bioinformatics applied in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology. 5 years of postdoctoral training with 3 first author/co-first author bioinformatics publications and many contributing author publications. Intensive experience in leading single cell-based analysis projects in immunotherapy drug testing using patient sample-sequencing data collaborating with biopharmaceutical companies and hospitals. Collaboration with lab scientists as a consultant in designing analyses and building algorithms to understand biological mechanisms under given situations. Proven ability to manage multiple projects in a well-organized manner and to construct neat file-sharing systems for collaborators. Experience in NGS assay development including lab-setting Drop-seq, Seq-Well, and Seq-scope during postdoctoral training. Familiar with R, Linux, and Python. I define myself a self-starter, detail-oriented/organized worker, and a team- player.
